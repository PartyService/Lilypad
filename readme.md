# Lilypad

Lilypad is a work-in-progress replica of the popular game Just Dance Now, built using the Electron framework. This project aims to recreate the core features of Just Dance Now, including the beat system, lyrics system, scoring system and parsing JDN (Just Dance Now) files.

## Features (Work in Progress)

### Parsing JDN Files
The core functionality of Lilypad revolves around parsing JDN files. JDN files are used by Just Dance Now to define the choreography and synchronization data for each song. Lilypad aims to parse these files and recreate the dance moves and synchronization in the game. This feature is still a work in progress and may undergo further development.

## Getting Started
To get started with Lilypad, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/PartyService/lilypad.git`
2. Install dependencies: `cd lilypad && npm install`
3. Start the application: `npm start`

Please note that since Lilypad is still a work in progress, there might be some incomplete or missing features. Development is ongoing, and updates will be made to improve the overall functionality of the application.
